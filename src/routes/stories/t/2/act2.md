His eyes opened to a very dimly lit room. Light shown in through the thin drapery, but it was far too dim to be sunlight. The bed he rested on was soft and warm, he could hardly believe that something so comfortable could exist in a place as ancient as the inn. He was so tired the night before that he didn't even change into different clothes. 

As he sat up, a voice rang out from the darkness.

A: "Are you awake?"

F: "Yeah... I'm awake."

A: "Did you sleep well?"

F: "Surprisingly well..."

He rubbed his eyes, his movements slow and sleepy. He looked at the watch on his wrist, but it seemed to have stopped.

A: "If you would like some breakfast, I have food prepared downstairs."

<!-- This line doesnt work well -->
F: "Wow... Thank you..."

He stood from the bed and put on his shoes. The lamps around the room illuminated, slowly getting brighter and brighter, filling the room with their warm glow. He exited the room, walking down the hallway towards the stairwell. 

Something caught his attention however. One of the rooms had a piece of paper with an intricately drawn symbol on it nailed to the door. The paper looked old and dry, curling slightly at the edges. He was too tired to have noticed it before. 

Walking down the stairs, the smell of warm eggs filled the air. On the table he had sat at before was a plate of the most delectable food he had ever seen. 

F: "Is this eggs benedict?"

A: "It is indeed, do you like it?"

F: "It's my favorite breakfast food..."

He sat down, eagerly picking up his fork and knife. The egg spilled its warm yolk all over the rest of the food as he cut into it. He took a bite, and bliss swept over him. It was just as delectable as it looked. 

F: "I don't know how, but this is the most delicious eggs benedict I've ever had."

A: "I'm glad you enjoy it!"

There was more joy and pride in her voice than he was expecting. It was almost like he could hear her smile.

He scarfed down his meal, even scraping what he could of the sauce off of the plate. 

F: "Maybe you are an angel... This was divine."

A: "I've never had someone call me such kind words before."

F: "What do people normally call you?"

A: "They call me a monster. A demon."

<!-- revise this line -->
F: "Why are people so afraid of you? Is it the whole noncorporeal voice thing?"

A: "I scare people when I talk to them. At some point, I gave up; it was better to stay hidden. But occasionally, when those who have come here have fallen to grief and despair, I try to help. But... it only seems to make things worse..."

F: "I see..."

<!-- this should be expanded on -->
The good mood from earlier had soured. Faron wasn't sure how to comfort her. 

F: "I can understand why people might be afraid. It's not often you talk to someone without a body..."

Faron paused for a brief moment, trying to figure out how to say how he felt. 

F: "But you're no monster. A monster wouldn't have given me such wonderful food, or given me a place to sleep, or given me such wonderful company."

A: "Do you really mean that?"

F: "Of course I do. With every fiber of my being."

A: "That... means a lot to me..."

F: "I do have to ask, do you *have* a physical body? I feel like people would be less afraid of you if they could see you."

<!-- A: "I'm not sure. I cannot " -->

A: "I don't know. Perhaps I had a body a long time ago, but like my name I've forgotten it."

F: "You've forgotten it?"

A: "I cannot control how I appear, just as you cannot change how you look."

F: "I guess that's fair enough. If you do have a body though I'd love to see it. I'm sure you're beautiful."

<!-- insert section where she talks about wanting to be more human -->

A long silence followed his words. Without a face to read, Faron couldn't tell how his compliment landed.

<!-- this should be moved maybe -->
F: "Hey, Angela, if you decided to stop talking to people, why did you talk to me?"

A: "I'm not sure... I guess you looked like you wanted someone to talk to..."

F: "I appreciate that..."


A: "Say, Faron, how long do you plan to stay in this village?"

F: "I'm not sure. Why do you ask?"

A: "I advise that you leave soon. I believe this town is cursed."

F: "Cursed? What do you mean?"

A: "Many of the people who come here disappear without ever leaving. They go insane or succumb to sadness."

F: "They can't leave? Why is that?"

A: "I wish I knew... All I know is that it's not safe for you to stay long."

F: "I see..."

<!-- add more to this line -->
Faron looked down.

A: "Are you not scared?"

F: "I am a little bit... But to be honest, I don't really want to leave."

A: "Why not? Do you not have friends and family waiting for you?"

F: "I have friends and family, but I don't think they're waiting for me."

Faron paused, forcing back the emotions he could feel building in his throat.

F: "I could never keep up with the expectations of my family. They had such big plans for me. But as I got older, things just kinda..."

Faron sighed.

F: "Eventually, their patience grew thin. At some point, even my favorite foods became too much effort to make. We don't talk much anymore."

A: "I'm sorry..."

F: "Then when it comes to my friends, we just kinda drifted apart. I was never the social type. It felt like I couldn't keep up with their energy. They all got closer, and I got further from them."

A: "I see... I'm sorry to hear that."

F: "It's fine, nobody did anything wrong, things just kinda fell apart."

A: "I know how it feels to be alone... I'm sorry things ended up the way they did."

F: "I imagine the travelers don't stick around for long, do they..."

A: "They don't at all. They come, and then for a short while they wander the town. But eventually every sign of them ever being here disappears."

F: "So the paper on the door upstairs was always there?"

A: "What paper?"

F: "The paper with the weird sign on it on the door upstairs."

A: "I don't know what you're talking about. No such paper exists."

He stood up from his seat.

F: "I swear something was there."

He walked up the stairs, to the door he saw earlier. Sure enough, the paper was still there.

F: "See, look!"

A: "Faron... There's no door there."

F: "What?"

He cautiously reached out his hand, grabbing the cold doorknob. He turned it, opening the door.

Inside was a room, not unlike the one from the inn. But the room seemed older, more worn and dusty. It was eerily quiet, the air cold and crisp. Perhaps it was the dust, but things seemed more gray, more sharp. 

F: "Angela?"

There was no response.

Faron walked further into the room, his footsteps breaking the unnatural silence. Upon further inspection, the room felt like a bedroom more than a room from an inn. Beneath the dust on the bed were colorful sheets, the desk in the corner had papers and books. The space seemed lived in, the exact opposite of the world outside. 

F: "Hey Angela, are you there?"

Again, only silence.

As he walked further into the room, he could peek around the bed. Tucked into the corner was what looked like a person. Their clothes looked ancient. They were covered in dust. Upon closer inspection, they were nothing but bones.

He jumped back, fear coming over him. As the initial shock waned, he wasn't sure what to do. He cautiously approached the corpse, inspecting it carefully. One hand held a small book, with its other hand holding a feather quill.

On the ground in front of it was some text, written in spilled ink.

F: "\"Miasma\"..."

He carefully picked up the small book, dusting it off. He flipped through its pages. The contents were archaic, it was difficult to read. Inside were drawings and diagrams that he could not understand. 

Eventually, he reached a section, almost like a journal. He read through its pages, one by one.  

<hr>

He closed the book. He staring at the cover, completely lost in thought. After some time, he placed the book in his pocket, and walked towards the door. He reached towards the handle, but hesitated for a moment. Finally, he opened the door.

A: "Faron?"

F: "Hey..."

A: "Where were you? You disappeared."

Her voice sounded worried. It made him feel weirdly nice. 

F: "I found a room back there..."

A: "Are you okay? You seem off?"

F: "Yeah, I'm fine."

He paused for a moment, collecting his thoughts.

F: "Sorry I was gone, what were we talking about before?"

<hr>

Faron opened the door to his room, yawning as he walked inside. 

F: "I'm sorry I have to end things early today, Angela."

A: "It is quite alright. You must still be tired from your journey."

F: "Do you ever get tired?"

A: "Not in the way you do. I don't think I sleep exactly, but I do rest in a way."

F: "Huh... Interesting. When do you do your "rest"?"

A: "I plan on resting shortly after you do."

F: "In that case I guess it's not too different than sleeping."

Faron took off his watch and placed it on the desk next to his bed. He started to pull off his shirt before stopping abruptly.

F: "Hey Angela, I'm not sure if it's possible for you to do, but are you able to give me some privacy?"

A: "Ah yes, of course. I'll say my goodnights now then. Goodnight Faron, I'll see you after your rest."

F: "Goodnight Angela."

The room felt more silent now.

Faron finished getting ready for bed, placing his shirt on the chair next to the desk. He laid in his bed, closing his eyes. And then he waited.

After waiting quite a while, longer than he felt he needed to wait, he sat up and got out of bed ever so quietly. He was careful not to make any noise with his footsteps. He slowly put on his shirt and grabbed his bag. For a moment he considered grabbing his watch, but even though it was frozen it still had a distinct ticking. He decided to leave it.

Slowly and deliberately, he opened his door and slowly made his way down the hallway. Every creak of the boards below his feet echoed in his ears. His heart raced. He managed to make it down the stairs, and out the door. 

The wind on the street put him at ease. He could relax a bit, as the stone ground made a much softer noise than the old planks of the inn. The fog was thick tonight, almost as thick as the night he came here. 

The village was just as maze-like as before. Nothing looked familiar. Every road and alley seemed exactly the same, yet at the same time completely unique. He tried to follow the path he had taken with Angela the day prior, but it almost felt as if the layout of the village had changed. It felt as if the village didn't want him to leave. 

However he kept going, trying to remember any details that he could. Eventually the buildings got less and less dense, the roads turned from stone to gravel, and then the roads led to nothing at all. He had reached the edge of the village.

A wave of relief washed over him. He was on the same path that he used to enter the village. Through the fog, he could barely make out the tree-line of the forest. He walked the now dirt road, carefully using the moonlight to make out the way in front of him. The fog seemed less dense than before. And then finally, he reached the entrance to the forest trail. 

It was smaller than when he first arrived, like if the forest was slowly consuming it. He placed down his bag, and pulled out his lantern. It was wrapped in cloth to stop it from squeaking. He unwrapped it, and lit the small flame inside. Its light started to illuminate the area around him. He held it up to the path before him. The trail seemed as dark as it was before, if not darker, like a light consuming void. 

He looked at the trail, and then back at the soft orange light of the village. The light from the village was not unlike that from his lantern. The fog started to roll back in. He looked back at the trail, and then down at his lantern. Slowly, he reached his other hand to the lantern, and hesitantly turned it off. There was rustling at the trail. In the moonlight he could see that the entrance had disappeared.

<!-- maybe consider adding line about rewrapping the lantern? -->
He turned and slowly started to walk back to the village.
