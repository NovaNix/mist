Faron opened his eyes to see the familiar ceiling of his inn room. He sat up and stretched. Despite sleeping for such a long time, he still felt a little drained. 

F: "Good morning..."

His voice was met with silence. 

F: "Angela, are you there?"

No response. He found it odd, considering how omnipresent she seemed to be before. He decided to get dressed before worrying. 

He shuffled out of bed, walking over to the small desk in the corner of the room. He picked up his clothes off the chair, putting them on as he went. Perhaps Angela was giving him some privacy, he thought. Nobody had seen Faron in any state of undress for a long time, so he appreciated it. 

Faron placed his watch on his wrist, tightening its strap. However it didn't seem to fit right. The watch was never a perfect fit, Faron was always on the skinnier side, but even the smallest notch left it a little loose. He decided that was good enough for now.

As he finished up, he was slightly startled by a knock on the door. 
<!-- It was odd to hear a noise that wasnt caused by him for once -->

He opened the door, and was left speechless. Before him was an absolutely beautiful woman, who gave him a smile as their eyes met. She looked to be about Faron's age, and she was about Faron's height too, if not a little shorter. He was so stunned that it was hard to focus on any one aspect of her. 

A: "Good morning!"

F: "Angela, is that you?"

A: "It is indeed, though I understand how you would be surprised."

F: "I thought you didn't have a body? How did this happen?"

<!-- This line could be improved a LOT  -->
A: "I didn't think I did, but somehow this happened..."

<!-- this line could be improved -->
Faron stood in awe, taking in the sight of her. 

A: "Do I look alright?"

She looked down, anxiously rolling her hair around her fingers. 

F: "You look absolutely amazing..."

She perked up immediately, giving Faron a smile that made him feel warm inside.

A: "Do you really think so?"

F: "Of course!"

A: "Ah, good! I was worried for a while... Thank you."

They stood there for a moment, almost blushing at each other before one of them worked up the courage to talk.

A: "Would you like to get some breakfast?"

F: "That sounds great!"

They both walked down the hallway towards the stairs. He could finally start to make out what she looked like. She wore a white shoulder-less shirt that was held up by straps, along with a medium length skirt. The material looked soft and high quality. 

F: "I like your outfit."

A: "Thank you! I got it from a store in town."

<!-- This doesnt flow well -->
They reached the stairs, and started walking down. About halfway down, Angela lost her footing. She let out a squeak, but Faron managed to catch her. She was soft and warm. 

A: "T-thank you... Sorry, I'm still not used to stairs just yet."

F: "Don't mention it, just make sure you're more careful..."

He helped her regain her footing, before they slowly finished their descent. 

A: "Now you sit here, I'll bring out your food in a second!"

She pulled out a chair at a small round table, which Faron happily sat on. Angela disappeared into one of the backrooms, giving Faron a second to regain his bearings. Before he knew it, she walked out wearing a cute apron, with two plates in hand. She placed them down on opposite ends of the table. 

F: "Scrambled eggs..."

A: "I thought I'd make another egg dish, I hope you like them..."

F: "I'm a little picky when it comes to my eggs... but the way you prepared them looks so absolutely delicious..."

<!-- change this line -->
She lit up like a lightbulb. 

A: "I'm happy you think so! Now wait just a little bit longer, I have one more thing to grab!"

She returned with two mugs in her hand, placing them next to their respective plates. 

F: "Is this coffee?"

A: "It is, yeah. You looked a bit tired, so I thought I'd give you something to wake you up... Do you not like it?"

Faron looked into the cup, mulling over how to respond. The coffee was light, it clearly had creamer and sugar put into it. 

F: "I'm not really a coffee guy, but if it's from you I'm willing to try it."

He took a small sip, careful not to burn himself. But his caution wasn't necessary. The coffee was the perfect temperature; hot enough where it warmed his mouth and throat, but not enough to where it was uncomfortable or painful to drink. His concerns over the taste were erased as well. The bitterness he associated with coffee was all but gone.

F: "This is good... If all coffee was made like this then I'd happily drink it..."

She took a small sip as well, smiling softly after swallowing. 

A: "It's so warm and sweet... It's lovely..."

F: "I guess this is one of the first things you've eaten, huh."

A: "It is..."

She looked down lovingly at the cup in her hand, swirling the contents of the cup slightly.

A: "I can feel the warmth of the drink... I can taste it... I can smell it... It feels so wonderful to exist..."

Her words made Faron slightly melancholic. 

<!-- this line can be improved -->
F: "I guess I take this sort of thing for granted... I'm glad you're finally able to experience this!"

She picked up her fork and started eating the eggs on her plate. Every bite she took made them look like the most delicious eggs in the world. Part of him wanted to continue their conversation, but she seemed to be enjoying herself, so he was content to just watch. He started eating too, though not with the vigor she had. 

<!-- this line could be improved -->
Before long, they finished their meal. Angela looked very content.

F: "Hey Angela, now that you have a body, is there anything you want to do?"

A: "What do you mean?"

F: "Well you seemed to enjoy eating, I figured there might be other experiences you might enjoy. Is there anything fun we could do in town?"

Angela contemplated for a moment.

A: "I'm not sure. I can't think of anything in particular that I want."

F: "Are there any shops?"

A: "There are, but nobody is there to sell anything..."

She had a disappointed look on her face. 

F: "That's fine, we can just window shop!"

A: "Yeah! Where do you want to go?"

<!-- She stood up from her seat, and Faron followed.  -->

<hr>

Faron and Angela walked down the road together. She was practically skipping down the road, humming a small tune while doing so. Meanwhile Faron found it hard to match her energy. She had to stop occasionally to let him catch up. 

The air was brisk; it was ever so slightly colder than before. The previously unrecognizable streets felt a little more familiar now. Faron wondered if it was because of his trip from the night before. It was still foggy enough that he couldn't see the sky, but the fog was the least dense he had ever seen it. 

After walking for a few minutes, they reached a quaint old bookstore, buried in-between two other buildings. The front of the store were large glass windows, though it was impossible to see inside. Massive shelves and the backs of books almost acted like curtains, making visibility difficult. 

They walked inside. A bell on the door pointlessly signaled their arrival. The inside was filled to the brim with books. From floor to ceiling there were rows and rows of books. In some spots it seemed like they gave up on filling shelves and instead piled the books on top of one another. It would be almost claustrophobic if it wasn't so charming. 

F: "Wow..."

<!-- add to this line -->
Faron was enamored. 

A: "Most of the books here are used, I apologize."

F: "No no, this is wonderful..."

He walked further inside, inspecting the shelves. Labels for each section were crudely drawn onto the shelves. The book selection was older than he was used to, but they had a good variety.

A: "Do you like reading?"

F: "I don't read as much as I used to, but I do. It's relaxing, and it's a good way to spend time when you're alone."

A: "What types of books do you enjoy?"

He pondered for a moment.

F: "I guess I gravitate towards fantasy, maybe romance depending on how I'm feeling. But I'm not super picky."

A: "Fantasy? Why is that?"

F: "I'm not sure. Sometimes it's nice to be able to worry about something fictional rather than something real."

A: "I see..."

<!-- include line here somewhere about the town matching his vibe -->

F: "What about you? Do you read?"

A: "I couldn't read before I had a body... Though a long time ago I remember being read fairytales."

F: "Fairytales?"

A: "Yes! They're so whimsical and wonderful, they're simple and relaxing, I have fond memories of them."

F: "Interesting..."

A: "But now that I can read, I think I might like to try reading a bit more. Do you have any recommendations?"

Faron smiled. 

F: "I'd be happy to find some for you!"

He inspected each shelf, going row by row, picking out a few books. After a few minutes he had a small stack of books.

F: "Most of the books here are pretty old, so I'm not familiar with most of these. But I was able to find a few classics that you might enjoy."

He placed the books down on the counter. 

F: "I actually brought a few books with me if you'd like to read those. They should be back at the inn."

A: "That would be lovely... Thank you so much!"

F: "If there's nobody here, do you think it's just fine to take these?"

A: "Nobody will mind, I doubt there will ever be anyone operating this shop."

Faron found a bag, and placed the books inside.

F: "Where do you want to go next?"

A: "You said you liked my outfit, right? Do you want to look at more clothes?"
