The forest was dark and quiet. All he could hear was the dirt underneath his feet, the echoes of his walking stick, and the quiet creaking of his lantern. The trail had become almost eerily quiet. Where there was once the soft rustling of leaves and the occasional chatter of wildlife, only silence remained.

The trees above blocked all moonlight, leaving his small lantern as his only source of light. But even that became limited, as the more he walked the more foggy it became. It felt as if the trail did not want to be followed. Regardless, he continued on.

A faint light in the distance became closer and closer until the forest gave way to a large clearing. A small village, lit by moonlight and flickering akin to torchlight, sat drenched in a thick fog. 

He stopped to take in the sight, or at least try to parse what he was seeing. The fog was so thick that he could barely see two feet in front of him. Without the village's lights, it would be impossible to tell anything was there. 

A: "Hello, traveler."

The woman's voice made him jump. It was monotone, lacking any sort of emotion, yet still soft and gentle. He raised his lantern to the fog, trying to find the source of the voice. But it was to no avail. He could not see even a silhouette.

F: "Who said that?"

A: "I did not mean to startle you."

He once again squinted to try to find the voice's origin. 

F: "Oh, don't worry about it. I just wasn't expecting to meet anyone, especially at this hour."

<!-- this could be better placed... -->
Faron glanced down at his wrist, but the darkness and fog made it difficult to read his watch.

A: "I apologize. You just seemed... lost."

F: "You could say that... I didn't know this trail led anywhere."

A: "Not many people come here. You're the first visitor in a long while." 

F: "Considering that this place isn't on any maps that I've seen, I don't doubt that..." 

A: "If this town wasn't your destination, then what brings you this way?"

He paused for a moment.

F: "It's complicated..."
<!-- F: "I guess I don't really have a destination in mind. I just... needed some fresh air." -->

<!-- A: "You're a strange person to be walking through the forest alone at night without a reason why." -->

<!-- I guess is repeated here -->
<!-- F: "I guess you're right..."  -->

His stomach growled. 

<!-- this flows a little weird -->
F: "There wouldn't happen to be any place in town that serves food that's open this time of night, would there?"

A: "If you're looking for food, then the inn should have what you seek."

F: "Where is that exactly?"

A: "It would be easier just to show you. Follow me."

A small flame appeared only a few feet away from where he was standing. It matched his own lanterns brightness and color, though through the fog it appeared as if the light was floating. Before he could react, it started slowly moving in the direction of the town. 

<hr/>

The streets of the town were tight, winding around like paths through a maze. Gas lamps illuminated the wooden and brick walls and cobblestone floors. The fog was thinner now, the lights seemingly keeping it away, though everything still felt just a little hazy. Something felt ever so slightly strange about the air. 

<!-- TODO expand on the air comment? -->
<!-- tawson said that it would be a good spot for a raw line, like the "the trail felt as if it did not want to be followed" from earlier -->

They passed by many stores and buildings, down streets and alleys, yet something was off. Lanterns lit up the buildings' interiors, but there wasn't a sign of anyone inside of them. The alleys and streets were dirty in the sense that there was dirt and grime, but they lacked the filth you'd expect from them. 

<!-- moth comment is weirdly placed -->
In fact, aside from the moths, there didn't seem to be any signs of life anywhere. The streets were completely empty, devoid of all people. There were no signs of rats or mice, no signs of horses or vehicles. Where you'd normally find a variety of bugs swarming the lanterns, there was nothing but the occasional moth. A ghost town, somehow maintained as if people were still living there. 

As peculiar as the town was though, something else had the bulk of his attention. The flame guiding him from before wasn't connected to anything at all. It did not belong to a candle or a lantern, nor was there anyone guiding the flame. It just hovered above the ground, moving eerily smooth down the street. 

The part of him that felt afraid was overpowered by confusion and curiosity. He couldn't even speak. He just followed the light. 

Before long they came to what he could only assume was the inn. The building had an old wooden door with windows lining the walls to each side of it. The flame stopped for a moment, before the old wooden door in front of it opened on its own. The flame continued on inside, and he followed. 

A wave of warmth washed over him. A fireplace sat opposite to the door, with a small group of tables and a bar to its left. To its right is what appeared to be a lounge, with a stairwell leading to the second floor.  

The flame flew over to one of the tables. 

A: "Please, eat this."

He walked over, and the flame disappeared. Sitting on the table was a bowl of chowder, with a spoon and a tall glass of water next to it. He paused for a moment. 

A: "Is something wrong?"

F: "No, no... Nothing is wrong..."

<!-- placed a spoonful doesn't sound quite right? -->
He sat down, and hesitantly picked up the spoon and placed a spoonful of soup in his mouth. He froze again.

F: "This soup... It's the exact same soup my parents used to make for me... Whenever I was having a bad day, they always made it for me to make me feel better. I couldn't even tell you the name of it, but it's the exact same."

His voice wavered a bit. He put the spoon down as his eyes began to tear up. 

A: "It's a thick and hearty soup, it's warm and easy to digest. I can see why they would make it for you."

He looked in the direction of her voice.

F: "What *are* you?"

A: "What am I?"

F: "I don't think you're human, are you? You're a magic voice that can make fire out of nothing and cook food. Are you a ghost? A will-o'-wisp?"

There was a moment of silence between them. 

A: "I don't know what I am."

He had a puzzled expression on his face. 

A: "Do I scare you?"

F: "I feel like I should be afraid, but for some reason I'm not."

A: "Y-you're not afraid of me?"

The slight tinge of emotion in her voice caught him off guard. Her voice had been so calm and precise to this point, hearing even a hint of sadness made him feel empathetic.

F: "You guided me through town, given me food I thought I'd never have again, and on top of that, you've given me someone to talk to. I'm not scared, if anything I'm thankful."

Silence overtook them; the type of silence that goes on a little too long. 

F: "Are you alright?"

A: "Yes. It's just that it has been such a long time since someone hasn't been afraid of me."

F: "With everything you've done for me, I'm starting to think I died in those woods and you're an angel."

A: "An angel..."

She paused for a long moment.

F: "Do you have a name? I'm realizing we never introduced ourselves."

A: "I used to have a name, a long time ago. It has been so long that I've forgotten."

F: "You forgot your own name?"

A: "It was given to me by a dear friend... But she is no longer here to call me by it."

F: "Oh... I'm sorry."

<!-- this line could be improved a bit. it doesnt flow naturally from the sorry -->
A: "If this is something that matters to you, then you may call me whatever you'd like."

F: "Are you sure?"

A: "You are the first person I've talked to in a long time. I think it is only fitting that you decide my name."

He sat there for a second.

F: "Well if you're an angel, then how about Angela?"

A: "Angela... I like it..."

F: "In that case, nice to meet you Angela, I'm Faron."

A: "It is a pleasure to meet you."

<!-- End of their introductions -->

A: "What brings you to this sleepy town?"

F: "I'm not really sure... I guess I don't really have a reason."

A: "You don't know?"

F: "Yeah, I guess I just needed to get away from everything."

A: "Traveling alone through the night without a reason is quite strange..."

F: "I guess it is, yeah...."

A: "Are you not worried for your safety? The forest is full of dangerous creatures."

Faron picked up his walking stick, hitting its base on the ground twice with two good thuds.

F: "That's what this is for."

He had a joking smile, though it wavered a bit when she was silent. He wondered if she was judging him or just in disbelief. 

A: "You seem wildly unprepared for the journey you're taking. Your stick seems more useful for walking then protection, and your bag seems unusually thin."

F: "Well I didn't exactly plan this excursion out, it was kinda impromptu..."

A: "Where do you plan to go when you leave this town?"

F: "I'm not sure. I think I'll just keep going until I find something interesting."

Angela paused again, before speaking with a level of concern in her voice. 

A: "I urge you to take some supplies with you when you go."

F: "I probably should, yeah..."

Faron paused, debating whether he should ask some of the questions on his mind.

F: "Hey Angela, is there anyone else here?"

A: "What do you mean?"

F: "While we were walking here I didn't see anyone, not a single person. I get this town is sleepy and all, but this town is oddly quiet..."

A: "Some people come and go, but right now I believe we are the only ones here."

F: "That's... unnerving. So if I wanted supplies, what do I do?"

A: "You can just take them. Nobody will mind."

F: "This town really is empty... Huh..."

He sad in silence for a bit, thinking of all of the implications of this information. 

F: "So why are you here?"

A: "I'm not sure what you mean."

F: "If there's no one else here, why are you here?"

A: "I'm not sure. I've been here as long as I can remember. Perhaps I was born here, perhaps I traveled here too..."

F: "Isn't it lonely? Being alone here I mean."

She paused again, which gave Faron the answer.

A: "It's... all I've ever known."

Her voice had a tinge of sadness again, as if she realized a truth that she had always known.

F: "Why do you stay here then?"

A: "I don't know. It's not something I've seriously considered. I'm not sure I could leave. This town is my home, no other place would feel right."

F: "I understand..."

They both sat in silence for a bit. 

F: "Hey, Angela, this is an inn, right? Would you mind if I stayed the night?"

<!-- A: "I don't mind at all." -->
