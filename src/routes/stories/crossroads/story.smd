H: "You're back again, huh?"

D: "Of course."

H: "I guess there's not much of a point in asking what you want..."

D: "..."

H: "Well I can't. Not yet."

D: "Do you really think that if you hold on just a bit longer that something will change?"

H: "To be honest, not really..."

D: "Then why are you still here?"

H: "I'm not sure... Maybe if I wait long enough, something *will* change."

D: "You've waited for so long."

H: "And in some ways things have gotten better, haven't they?"

D: "But things have also gotten worse in other ways."

H: "The doctors say I've improved... I might have the strength to walk again soon..."

D: "Do you believe them?"

H: "..."

D: "You've endured so much pain and suffering."

H: "And I'll endure more."

D: "For how long?"

H: "I don't know. As long as it takes I guess."

D: "Is this a life you want to live?" 

H: "Not really...."

D: "Then why?"

H: "There are plenty of reasons why."

D: "Like what?"

H: "There are people who care about me."

D: "There are people who hate to watch you suffer."

H: "I think they'd rather watch me suffer than not see me at all..."

D: "I think they want to see you at peace."

H: "And they'll see me at peace once I'm better."

D: "Are you going to get better?"

H: "I hope so."

D: "And what if you don't. How much worse do things need to get before you let go?"

H: "Why are you so adamant about this?"

D: "..."

H: "Where were you when I asked for you?!" 

D: "..."

H: "Where were you when I couldn't take it anymore?!"

D: "..."

H: "You weren't there when I needed you. I refuse to go with you now."

D: "Your pleas were empty. You asked for something you were not ready to accept."

H: "I *was* ready."

D: "If you were, you wouldn't be here right now."

H: "..."

D: "Tell yourself what lies soothe you, but in truth you refuse to let go."

H: "... how could I let go... if I let go, what do I have left?"

D: "If you let go, you'll find peace."

H: "If I let go, I'll have nothing."

D: "You'll find something new."

H: "But it won't be this, will it?"

D: "Does it matter?"

H: "It does to me..."

D: "Why."

H: "Do I need a reason? I want to live the life I've been given."

D: "You haven't been given a life to live."

H: "I've been given *something* at least..." 

D: "..."

H: "I've held on this long, I can hold on for just a bit longer..."

D: "..."

H: "Hello?"
